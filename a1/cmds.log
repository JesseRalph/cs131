Task 1: What is your home directory path?

cd ~
pwd


Task 2a: Using only "ls" (and maybe "grep"), can you find out which file under directory /proc/ contains information about memory (mem) on your server?

ls -a /proc/ | grep -i 'mem' #check for files with "mem" in the name, find two, iomem and meminfo
cat /proc/iomem              #check contents to confirm
cat /proc/meminfo            #check contents to confirm


Task 2b: Which file contains information about the CPU's on your server?

ls -a /proc/ | grep -i 'cpu'  #check for files with "cpu" in the name, find just 1
cat /proc/cpuinfo             #check contents to confirm


Task 3a: Identify the operating system version.
ls -a /etc/ | grep -i "^os\|os$" #check for files starting or ending in "os", one of which is os-release
cat /etc/os-release              #we see a line with the string VERSION=
grep "VERSION=" /etc/os-release  #this gives us out final output, the answer


Task 3b: Which file under /etc/ contains this information?
ls -a /etc/ | grep -i "^os\|os$" #same command as 3a


Task 4: Using the taxi dataset (2019-04.csv):

Task 4a: Sort the pickup location IDs in order to find the most popular pickup locations on April 2nd, 2019. Identify the top 3 locations.

answer:
cut -d',' -f2,8 ../../2019-04.csv | grep "2019-04-02" | cut -d',' -f2 | sort -g | uniq -c | sort -g | tail -3

breakdown:
we pipe the result of each of these commands to be the argument of the command that follows:

cut -d',' -f2,8 ../../2019-04.csv #we reduce each line to just
                                  #the 2nd column, the pickup dates, and the
                                  #the 8th column, the pickup location IDs 
grep "2019-04-02" #only lines with the desired date (April 2nd, 2019) in the pickup column
cut -d',' -f2     #we remove the pick up column, now we only have a list of pickup location IDs
sort -g           #sort numerically
uniq -c           #count occurences of each pickup location ID
sort -g           #sort again, this time by the count we added to the start
tail -3           #we look at the last 3, which are the largest 3 counts due to our sort


Task 4b: Sort the pickup location IDs in order to find the most popular pickup locations on April 10th, 2019. Identify the top 3 locations.

cut -d',' -f2,8 ../../2019-04.csv | grep "2019-04-10" | cut -d',' -f2 | sort -g | uniq -c | sort -g | tail -3

breakdown:

Same as 4a, but with the string "2019-04-10" in the place of "2019-04-02".
