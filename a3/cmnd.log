# This file can also act as a bash script to create the required output in a3.txt.


# To use this file as a bash script, enter the following in the terminal:
#
# chmod 500 cmnd.log
# ./cmnd.log

# Alternatively, you can just enter the following two lines into the command line.
# The first command generates the required output text and overwrites a3.txt with it.

awk -f grader.awk grades.csv > a3.txt

# The second command just displays that text to stdout.

cat a3.txt
